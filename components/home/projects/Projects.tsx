          I'm diving into the world of art classification with cutting-edge
          neural networks! This project leverages the diverse WikiArt dataset
          from Hugging Face to train models that classify artworks into multiple
          categories, including genre and style. Unlike traditional single-label
          tasks, my approach tackles the complexity of multi-class
          classification, predicting multiple attributes of each piece to
          provide a rich, nuanced understanding of artistic creations.

          The live demo above showcases my custom React interface, which
          interacts with my trained model for inference via an API hosted on
          Hugging Face. To explore my Hugging Face space and check out other
          spaces Iâ€™ve created, simply click the link below.

          In our fast-paced world, having a personal assistant can make life
          significantly easier. While some are fortunate enough to have one,
          most of us rely on virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google
          Assistant, and now, My Assistant.

          This project serves as a capstone endeavor towards earning my MIT
          Applied Data Science certification. In this project, I selected a
          dataset, trained custom models, and employed transfer learning to
          classify images. The final stage involved presenting the resulting
          metrics for each experiment in a live presentation.

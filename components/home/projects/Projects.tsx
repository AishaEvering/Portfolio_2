          I'm diving into the world of art classification with cutting-edge
          neural networks! This project leverages the diverse WikiArt dataset
          from Hugging Face to train models that classify artworks into multiple
          categories, including genre and style. Unlike traditional single-label
          tasks, my approach tackles the complexity of multi-class
          classification, predicting multiple attributes of each piece to
          provide a rich, nuanced understanding of artistic creations.

          The live demo above showcases my custom React interface, which
          interacts with my trained model for inference via an API hosted on
          Hugging Face. To explore my Hugging Face space and check out other
          spaces Iâ€™ve created, simply click the link below.

          This project serves as an capstone endeavor undertaken to advance
          towards achieving my MIT Applied Data Science certification. In this
          project I had to select a dataset and train custom models and use
          tranfer learning to classify images. The final portion of the final

          each experiment.

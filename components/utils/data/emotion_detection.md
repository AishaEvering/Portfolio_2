# Emotion Detection

This project serves as an capstone endeavor undertaken to advance towards achieving my MIT Applied Data Science certification.

## Overview

In this project, I aimed to develop a multi-class classification model to detect emotions-sad, happy, surprised, and neutral-from facial images. The primary goal was to create an accurate model that can reliably classify emotions baseed on visual input.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Impact of Transfer Learning:** Retraining models for transfer learning significantly improved performance. Although I observed promising results using VGG16, time constraints led me to pause further experiments. Nevertheless, this experience reinforced the value of transfer learning in enhancing model accuracy.
2. **No Guarantees with Transfer Learning:** Despite its advantages, transfer learning does not automatically ensure high accuracy. Each model and dataset require careful tuning and evaluation.
3. **Grayscale vs RGB:** Using grayscale images versus RGB images did not result in substantial differences in model performance.
4. **Importance of Data Augmentation:** Although exploratory data analysis (EDA) was limited for the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), augmenting and flipping images proved effective in improving accuracy.

## Key Takeaways

- CNN vs Transfer Learning: In this particular case, a basic CNN model outperformed transfer learning approaches. This highlights that, while advanced techniques like transfer learning can be beneficial, simpler models can sometimes yield better results depending on the context.

### Challenges Faced

- **Ineffective Transfer Learning with EfficientNet**: I encountered difficulties using the EfficientNet model for transfer learning, as it did not produce satisfactory results. This experience underscored the complexity and challenges of selecting and tuning pre-trained models for specific tasks.

### Next Steps

- **Present Findings:** Share detailed insights and results from this project.
- **Certification:** Obtain my MIT Applied Data Science Certificate to further validate and enhance my expertise.

### Dataset Details

- **Training Data:** 15,109 images
- **Testing Data:** 128 images
- **Validation Data:** 4,977 images
- **Location:** All data is available on my Google Drive.

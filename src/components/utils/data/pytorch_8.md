# Experiment Tracking

Running experiments and using Tensor Board to analyze the results.

## [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AishaEvering/PyTorch_Exercises/blob/main/07_pytorch_experiment_tracking_exercise_template.ipynb)

- **Key Takeaways**

  - Things are getting fun. I really like experimenting with data and code.
  - Tensor board is amazing, I understand there are more popular platforms. But today is Tensor board day.
  - Tensor board Dev is shutdown. :-(
  - You guessed it, the more data and the longer training (to a point) is a great way to increase accuracies while decreasing loss.
  - Larger models does not automatically mean better metrics.
  - Didn't really get a lot of great metrics when adding augmentation.
  - Finally getting respectable metrics with transfer learning and training multiple models at once. (I really love setting up the experiments. If you someone is reading this and does this as part of their career. Wow, how lucky are you.)

- **Where I Got Stuck**

  - Google got me for $10 dollars because I could no longer run my tests on Google Colab. :-(
  - Choosing the correct augumentation without running into, "TypeError: Caught TypeError in DataLoader worker process 0."

- **TIL (I have my hand in several aspects of Machine Learning so sometimes I will come across something I thought was cool and need a place to remember it. This is that place.)**

  - I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to a professional representation of what training a model is like outside the cloud. This is my introduction to Tensor Board. I really like this.

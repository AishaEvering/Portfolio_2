# Custom Datasets

Creating, using, transforming custom datasets with PyTorch.

## [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/AishaEvering/PyTorch_Exercises/blob/main/04_pytorch_custom_datasets_exercises.ipynb)

- **Key Takeaways**
  - Use PyTorch torchvision transform to resize and alter images for more variability in the test data.
  - Created custom dataset class, which was pretty straight forward.
  - Experimented multiple models with various custom datasets and epochs
- **Where I Got Stuck**

  - Not getting great results from the models this time. That was not really the point to the exercise to I didn't spend a lot of time adding transformations or tuning hyperparameters. But I'll probably return to this is get higher accuracy values.

- **TIL (I have my hand in several aspects of Machine Learning so sometimes I will come across something I thought was cool and need a place to remember it. This is that place.)**

  - here weren't a lot of 'AHA!' moments, but I was introduced to how to augment images using TensorFlow-like techniques in PyTorch in this chapter. I experimented with many of the torchvision.transforms and still didn't cover them all. This is a great way to increase your data variability.

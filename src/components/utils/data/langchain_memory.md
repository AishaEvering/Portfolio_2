# LangChain Practice

## Description

This is a simple console application that accepts user input and maintains a 'memory' of the conversation, ensuring the LLM retains context.

## Core Concepts Practiced

- Conversation Summary Memory: Is a feature that helps an AI or chatbot remember the important parts of a conversation. Instead of just remembering everything said, it focuses on summarizing the key points so the AI can keep track of the main topics and context, making future interactions more coherent and relevant.
- Chat Prompt Template: Similar to a PromptTemplate, but specifically designed for conversational contexts. It manages different roles, like AI and Human, and helps structure dialogues effectively.
